```

And then, run this please:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the test.

## Implemented Technologies

Please, let me show you all of tools that i used, to build this test:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- And another more tools 😎 .


You can check the rest on package.json file!
